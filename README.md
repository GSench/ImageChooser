# ImageChooser
Web page that helps to choose the best photo from your list with A/B testing
### Why do you need it?
Have you ever taken a lot of similar pics and now you need to choose one for Instagram/Gallery/Facebook ?
This simple web app provides possible decision for such case.
### The idea
It's too hard to make a choice, looking at a list of 100 photos. But you can easily decide between two pictures.
Thus, you can choose the best photo passing A/B testing.
### Functional
[Add images] button allows to load photos for testing. You can add new images at any time, even during the test running.

To make decision you need to click on preferred picture or [THIS] button in [Slider mode]
The next variants will be offered randomly.

[Skip] button is for skipping current A & B pictures and returning for this choice next time.

[Save chosen image for next decision] checkbox leaves preferred picture in the next A/B selection.

All radio buttons are needed to select view mode.

[Compare mode] — both images are placed on the page to fit the window.

[Slider mode] — image fits the whole window. Clicking on image switches between A & B. To make decision you need to click [THIS] button.

[Scroll mode] — every image is placed vertically on the page to fit the window.

[Go fullscreen] button switches to full screen. Press Esc or Back to exit fullscreen mode.
